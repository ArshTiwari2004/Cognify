## Problem Statement :

### Smart Study Note Organizer

Create a web-based application tailored for students to organize, enhance, and optimize
their study notes. The app should automatically categorize notes by subject or topic, link
related concepts to help users see the bigger picture, and generate flashcards for quick
revision. It could include features like optical character recognition (OCR) for scanning
handwritten notes, audio-to-text transcription for recording lectures, and collaborative note
sharing for group studies. The app should employ AI to suggest improvements, detect
knowledge gaps, and provide supplemental resources (e.g., relevant videos or articles).
Gamification elements, such as streaks for regular studying or quizzes based on the
notes, could be added to motivate users.
